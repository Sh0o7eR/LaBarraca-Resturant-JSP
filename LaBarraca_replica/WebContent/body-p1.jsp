                                    <p>Coincidentally visited because another restaurant was closed .... luckily that other restaurant was closed, because that would certainly have been more disappointing compared to La Barraca.

                                    <br>  Delicious diner, nice service, clean interior. It just all worked out.</p>

                                    <p>Again a delicious diner at "LA BARRACA". This is currently the best tapas restaurant in Maastricht. Original, distinct, fine flavors and super fresh products! Tasty wines, delicious coffee, creative cocktails!

                                    <br>   Fine service, young but knowledgeable and cordial! The prices are not low but you will get something good for it!</p>

                              <p>Originally the tapa is Spanish but that does not mean that the Spaniards have the exclusive right to this 'little snack'.

                                   <br><br> We have worked the traditional tapas through our whole menu. We have created different types of recipes to be tapas. Others are variations on classic or traditional dishes or snacks from other countries. The great thing about tapas is that you enjoy them with friends at any time of the day.
                                    
                                   <br><br> Eating small snacks and dishes is especially a tradition in the Mediterranean countries. In Italy the antipasta and in the Middle East the mezzeh (dishes with all kinds of snacks as an appetizer). And in Greece, the mia pikilia (one full meal of small snacks without main dish).
                                    
                                   <br><br> Our tapas are not served all at once, of course you can indicate how and when you have want to order.</p>
